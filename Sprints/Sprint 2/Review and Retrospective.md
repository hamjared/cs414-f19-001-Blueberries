# Review 
- The goal of the sprint review is to present the work done to the product owner. 
- Held with Product Owner on 10/31

## Output of the Review
The overall review went well, but the product owner brought up several issues with our design of the product. Issues such as too small font, the usable of the product is very techincal, and we need to improve it so a regular person can use our product. Product owner also brought up the issue of acceptance tests and how they should match the user stories. Along with the acceptance tests, the features we impelented this sprint should be perfect. Also there are many bugs that the product owner found unacceptable, and we need to address them. During the review we also went over what was need for the deilverables and the presentation for this sprint.

# Retrospective

## Things that went well
After going over, redoing, and breaking up the user stories, we came out with well defined tasks, that made it easier to work with. From last sprint and this sprint, we as a group has had very good communication with using slack to communicate about issues we are having or telling each other about what we are working on. After the first meeting with the product owner, we had a clear definition of what the product owner wanted for this sprint, and we set out to accomplish them.

## Things that need to be improved for Sprint 3
For next sprint, we as a group need to meet more often with the product owner in order to gain more feedback about our product and to have a better definition of the what the product owner wants for next sprint. We also need to add more tests to both the client and server side to bring up our code coverage. While our code coverage is at 68%, we need more tests to bring up the code coverage to a more respectable level. Next sprint we can also work on improve our burndown chart, and have a more linear burndown instead of a dropoff.
