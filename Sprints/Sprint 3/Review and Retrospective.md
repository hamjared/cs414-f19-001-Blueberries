# Review 
- The goal of the sprint review is to present the work done to the product owner. 
- Held with Product Owner on 12/5

## Output of the Review
The overall review went poorly, as the product owner brought up major several issues with our design of the product. Some of the major issues
include missing features that are required, Bad UI, some features not working, product is buggy. The product owner suggest changes to the game
page, by seperating out the games into tabs. Also suggest the we change from using email as the display name, and use userID/usernames.
In the review we also take about requires for the end of the sprint and the presentation.

# Retrospective

## Things that went well
Since last sprint we implemented several major features that are requried, such as a invite system, and game history, and moving our game
usable from a techincal level to a user friendly one with clickable moves instead of text. THe first meeting with the product owner this sprint,
gave us a direction to work towards which was the requirements of P1, have to be met. This sprint, we continue to have good communicate using slack
to talk about issues we are having, planning meeting, and delgating tasks.

## Things that need to be improved 
In the future, we need to start working earlier during the sprint so we are not as stressed or burned out from trying to do everything 
in the last week. We should also meet more with the product owner to get more feedback, so we as a team can be more prepare for the
end of the sprint and to have a better definition of the what the product owner wants. We also need to bring up our code coverage 
on the client side. Another aspect we can improve on, is refactor our code on the client side, as some of the pages such as
the home page is a big mess of spaghetti code.
